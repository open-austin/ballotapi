    Rate Limits
</h1>
<p>
    By default, you don't need an access token to use Ballot API. Just start
    making requests to <a href="{{ '/docs/api' | relative_url }}">endpoints</a>!
    However, since these requests are unauthenticated we will rate limit
    how fast you can make requests to prevent abuse.
</p>
<ul>
    <li id="rate-limit" class="permalink-wrapper">
        <strong>Current rate limit:</strong>
        2 requests per second per IP address.
        <a href="#rate-limit" class="permalink"></a>
    </li>
    <li id="queue-limit" class="permalink-wrapper">
        <strong>Current queue limit:</strong>
        20 requests per IP address.
        <a href="#queue-limit" class="permalink"></a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We rate limit requests using the "leaky bucket" method. We only
    respond to requests at the above rate (e.g. the leak in the bucket). If
    you send more requests than the rate limit, your requests will queue up
    (e.g. filling up the bucket). If you max out the queue limit (e.g.
    overflow the bucket), we will begin rejecting your requests with a
    <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response.
</p>
<p>
    If you see a
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        429 response code
        <small class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></small></a>, check the
    <code>Retry-After</code> header for how many seconds to wait until trying
    the request again.
</p>

<h3 id="client-apps" class="permalink-wrapper">
    Making requests from client applications
    <a href="#client-apps" class="permalink"></a>
</h3>
<p>
    If you have an website or native app where you are making requests from
    that client, our rate limits shouldn't affect your application much.
    Since our rate limits are per-IP address, each of your users will likely
    be able to use the API at the default rate limit.
</p>
<p>
    A good practice for websites (e.g. javascript webapps), and native apps
    is to only send one API request at a time and wait for the response
    before sending another request.
</p>

<h3 id="central-server" class="permalink-wrapper">
    Making requests from a central server
    <a href="#central-server" class="permalink"></a>
</h3>
<p>
    If you have a central server that is going to make a significant volume
    of requests, you will likely run into our default rate limits pretty
    quickly. There are several options to get around our default limits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Option 1: Self-rate limit.</strong><br>
    Queue up requests on your server and then dispatch them to our API until
    you start seeing 429 responses. Then, wait the given Retry-After seconds
    and start making requests again. This basically is making a leaky bucket
    you can manage on your side.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Option 2: Run a local mirror.</strong><br>
    Our dataset is public domain and our software is open source, so you are
    welcome to <a href="#TODO">download a copy</a> and run the API on
    your internal network.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Option 3: Donate hosting costs.</strong><br>
    If you don't want to mirror the API yourself, you can donate to this
    project and we'll dedicate some extra servers to accomodate your extra
    requests.
</p>

<h3 id="large-networks" class="permalink-wrapper">
    Making requests from large networks/public wifi
    <a href="#large-networks" class="permalink"></a>
</h3>
<p>
    If you are on a large shared or public network (e.g. a college campus or
    conference center), everyone on your network will likely have the same
    IP address and so everyone will be sharing the same rate limit. If
    there's a lot of people using our API on your network, you might start
    seeing 429 responses fairly often.
</p>
<p>
    We don't want shared networks to disrupt user experience, so we do offer
    whitelisting certain IP ranges for bigger rate limits. Simply open a
    <a href="https://github.com/open-austin/ballotapi/pulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        pull request
        <small class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></small></a>, and
    we'll see what we can do.
</p>

<h3 id="scraping" class="permalink-wrapper">
    Scraping the API
    <a href="#scraping" class="permalink"></a>
</h3>
<p>
    With the default rate limits, it would take quite a long time to scan
    or scrape the entire API. But there's really no reason to! The entire
    dataset is public domain and you can <a href="#TODO">download a copy</a>.
